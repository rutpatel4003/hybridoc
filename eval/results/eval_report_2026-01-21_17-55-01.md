## Interpretation

- **Hit Rate**: % of queries where at least one relevant doc was in top-k
- **Recall@k**: Average fraction of expected pages/sources found in top-k  
- **MRR**: Mean Reciprocal Rank — how high the first relevant result ranks
- **Latency**: End-to-end retrieval time (embedding + search + rerank)

## Recommendations

- ✅ Retrieval quality looks good!
